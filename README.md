# üß† Mental Health in Tech - Classification Project

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

This dataset explores various factors related to **mental health in the workplace**, especially within the **technology industry**. The goal is to predict whether an individual has sought **treatment for mental health issues** based on multiple workplace, personal, and demographic factors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned inconsistent labels (e.g., gender values like `Femake`, `Male-ish`, `cis male`)
- Encoded categorical variables using label encoding or ordinal mapping
- Removed irrelevant or low-importance features ( most important )

## Problem with the Data
The main issue in the visualization of Treatment with all the other columns is that in most of the columns if the value is `No`, the **Treatment** has equal or more distribution for `YES` rather than `No`. which may cause the bad learning of the model while training.

So we actually has to check whether these graphs actaully has any affect on the treatment which is our Label, while on training. For that, we will use **Cramers Algorithm** to calculate the weightage.

## ü§ñ Models Used

## üìå Project Goal

To build a robust classification model that can **identify individuals likely to seek treatment** for mental health, helping inform policy or workplace support systems.
